## Submission Policy
All homework submissions must be submitted to Gradescope (entry code: TBA ) by 11:59 pm on the due date. 
* To easily identify you, use your KFUPM email and enter your name as written in the university's system.
* Please ensure you have a good way to scan your homework. You can use a traditional scanner or a scanner app on your smartphone (if it has a good camera) 
* We highly recommend typesetting your homework in [LATEX](https://www.overleaf.com).
A bonus point in the homework will be give for those who do so. We will be posting the LaTeX source code of the homework assignments so you can borrow the LaTex code from the problem statements.

## Late Day Policy
You will have a total of 6 late days to use on homework assignments with a maximum of 2 late days on a single assignment. Each late day can be treated as a 24-hr extension; e.g., if the assignment is due Wednesday at 11:59 pm, you may hand it in by Thursday at 11:59 pm and use one late day, or by Friday at 11:59 pm and use two late days. You are responsible for keeping track of your late days. No credit will be given for homework turned in after 48 hours past the due date, or for late homework after all late days have been used.

## Collaboration Policy and Honor Code
Students must work individually on all homework assignments. We encourage you to have high-level discussions with other students in the class about the assignments, however, we require that when you turn in an assignment, it is only your work. That is, copying any part of another student’s assignment is strictly prohibited. You are free to reuse small snippets of example code found on the Internet (e.g. via StackOverflow) provided that it is attributed.

* The following is OK: You and your friend work through the problems together over a couple of days. You bounce ideas off each other, and eventually come up with a pretty good solution idea. You sit down at your computer and type up that idea in your own words, perhaps lightly consulting notes you took while working with your friend.
* The following is **NOT** OK: You and your friend work through the problems together over a couple of days. You bounce ideas off each other, and eventually come up with a pretty good solution idea. Your friend types up their solutions first; since you helped come up with the answers, you use your friend’s write-up as a starting point for your own.

Here are a few of the examples of honor code violations:
* Looking at the writeup or code of another student.
* Showing your writeup or code to another student.
* Discussing homework problems in such detail that your solution (writeup or code) is almost identical/ or showing high similarity to another student’s answer.
* Entering homework questions into any software, apps, or websites. Accessing resources that directly explain how to answer questions from the actual assignment or exam is a violation of course policy.

## Generative AI Tools Policy: 
In this course, every element of class assignments must be fully prepared by the student. The use of generative AI tools for any part of your work is not allowed and will be treated as plagiarism – unless it is permitted and announced by the instructor.
