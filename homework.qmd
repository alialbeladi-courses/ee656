### Quick checklist (submission)
- Submit **one PDF** (clear scans, high contrast).

## Policies

::: {.accordion}
::: {.accordion-item}
### Collaboration policy and honor code
Homework must be completed **individually**.  
You may discuss concepts and approaches at a high level, but your submitted work must be entirely your own.

- Copying any part of another student’s solution is not allowed.
- Copying code or derivations is not allowed.

Small snippets of publicly available code (e.g., StackOverflow) may be used **only if properly attributed**, and only when permitted by the homework instructions.
:::

::: {.accordion-item}
### Generative AI tools policy
Unless explicitly permitted by the instructor for a specific assignment, the use of generative AI tools for any part of your homework is **not allowed** and will be treated as plagiarism.
:::

::: {.accordion-item}
### Regrade policy
Regrade requests are submitted through Gradescope. Include a clear explanation of the grading error.

- Deadline: within **1 week** of receiving your grade, by **11:59 PM**.
- We may regrade the entire assignment (your score may go **up or down**).

**Legitimate requests**
- Points were added incorrectly.
- The answer exists but was on a different page.
- The grader claims a specific case fails, but your implementation works for that case.

**Illegitimate requests**
- Disagreeing with the rubric / asking for more partial credit without an error.
- “My solution wasn’t clear, but what I meant was correct.”
