## Policies

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### Late days
You have **6 late days** total, with a maximum of **2 late days per assignment**.  
Each late day is a **24-hour extension** (e.g., Wed 11:59 PM → Thu 11:59 PM = 1 late day).  
No credit is given after **48 hours** past the deadline, or after late days are exhausted.

### Collaboration policy and honor code
Homework must be completed **individually**.  
You may discuss concepts and approaches at a high level, but your submitted work must be entirely your own.

- Copying any part of another student’s solution is not allowed.
- Copying code or derivations is not allowed.

Small snippets of publicly available code (e.g., StackOverflow) may be used **only if properly attributed**, and only when permitted by the homework instructions.

### Generative AI tools policy
Unless explicitly permitted by the instructor for a specific assignment, the use of generative AI tools for any part of your homework is **not allowed** and will be treated as plagiarism.

### Regrade policy
Regrade requests are submitted through Gradescope. Include a clear explanation of the grading error.

- Deadline: within **1 week** of receiving your grade, by **11:59 PM**.
- We may regrade the entire assignment (your score may go **up or down**).

**Legitimate requests**
- Points were added incorrectly.
- The answer exists but was on a different page.
- The grader claims a specific case fails, but your implementation works for that case.

**Illegitimate requests**
- Disagreeing with the rubric / asking for more partial credit without an error.
- “My solution wasn’t clear, but what I meant was correct.”
