## EE656 Course Project
The project is a major part of the course and is designed to develop practical skill in **robot modeling and control**.
You will choose a topic, implement/validate a method, and communicate results in a short technical report and presentation.
:::

---

## Overview

### Goal
Build and evaluate a robotics/control solution that connects course theory to a realistic problem.

**Typical project directions**
- Modeling + control of a manipulator (joint-space control, computed torque, gravity compensation)
- Kinematics/IK with constraints and singularity handling
- Trajectory generation and tracking performance comparison
- Dynamics identification or parameter sensitivity analysis
- Task-space control concepts (if covered/time-permitting)

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### Recommended scope
A strong project is **small but complete**: clear problem statement → method → implementation → evaluation → conclusions.
:::

---

## Team rules

- Teams of **1–3 students** (unless announced otherwise).
- Everyone must contribute to implementation and writing.
- You may use simulation environments and public libraries, but you must **cite** external resources and clearly state what you reused.

---

## Deliverables

| Deliverable | What to submit | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Proposal** | 1–2 pages PDF | problem, approach, expected results, tools, timeline |
| **Checkpoint** | short update (slides or memo) | what works, what doesn’t, next steps |
| **Final report** | 6–10 pages PDF | conference-style writing with figures and results |
| **Presentation / demo** | slides + (optional) short video | 8–12 minutes typical |

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
### Report quality expectations
Your report should include: **problem statement**, **method**, **implementation details**, **results**, and **discussion**.
Plots must be labeled and readable; claims must be supported by results.

## Milestones (template)

Dates will be posted on the Schedule page. This is the typical flow:

- **Week 2–3:** topic selection + team formation
- **Week 4:** proposal due
- **Week 7–8:** checkpoint / early results
- **Final weeks:** final report + presentation/demo

## Evaluation rubric (high level)

| Category | Weight | What we look for |
|---|---:|---|
| **Technical correctness** | 35% | correct formulation, sound method, correct implementation |
| **Results & evaluation** | 30% | meaningful experiments, clear comparisons, insights |
| **Clarity & communication** | 20% | well-structured report, readable figures, clear writing |
| **Originality & ambition** | 15% | thoughtful problem choice, extensions beyond baseline |

---

## Topic ideas (starter list)

- Compare **PD vs computed-torque** on a 2-link arm (tracking + robustness tests)
- Study **IK methods** (Jacobian transpose vs pseudoinverse vs damped least squares)
- Analyze **singularities** and mitigation strategies in task-space motion
- Trajectory design: compare **cubic vs quintic** polynomials for smoothness and tracking
- Add constraints: joint limits, velocity limits, simple obstacle avoidance

## Academic integrity

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
You may collaborate within your team, but the final submission must reflect your team’s own work.
All external resources (code, figures, ideas) must be **cited**.

## FAQ

**Do we need hardware?**  
No—simulation-only projects are acceptable and often recommended.

**Can we reuse code?**  
Yes, but cite it and clearly state what you implemented vs reused.

**What if our results are negative?**  
That’s okay. A good project can show what didn’t work and why, as long as the evaluation is thoughtful.
