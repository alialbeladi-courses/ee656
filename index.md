## Course Overview
This course explores the theory and application of probabilistic and geometric techniques for autonomous mobile robotics. It critically examines state-of-the-art algorithms that enable robots to perceive, map, and navigate in dynamic environments. Topics include:
* Bayesian filtering and stochastic environment representations.
* Motion and sensor models for mobile robots.
* Algorithms for localization and mapping.
* Applications to autonomous ground, marine, and aerial vehicles.

The focus is on understanding and implementing the mathematical and algorithmic foundations that underpin modern robotic systems. By the end of the course, students will be equipped to design robust perception pipelines and critically analyze the latest research in robotics.

**What You Will Learn:** 
In this course, you will explore the essential techniques required to model, analyze, and design control systems. By the end of the course, you will have a solid understanding of how to create effective and robust control solutions for a variety of dynamic systems, from mechanical and electrical systems to real-world examples like quadrotor drones.

**Note:** The course focuses primarily on mathematical and computational aspects of robotics. It does not cover the mechanical or electrical design of robotic platforms.
