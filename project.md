# Overview
The goal of your project is to try something new and, perhaps, to contribute something to the field of Robotics. Projects should be done in **groups of two**. Individual projects require the instructor's approval before submission of the project proposal. Feel free to use the ["Project teammate search"](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Aed7d1f50d13b488db4f9c2eee4db0209%40thread.tacv2/Project%20teammate%20search?groupId=0a17bb8b-effd-4595-a721-04f5c3d73e7e&tenantId=29b4b088-d27d-4129-b9f9-8637b59ea4b3) channel on MSTeams to form teams. There is also a ["Project Ideas"](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3A7339df7f90004407b7357b7b88aca647%40thread.tacv2/Project%20Ideas?groupId=0a17bb8b-effd-4595-a721-04f5c3d73e7e&tenantId=29b4b088-d27d-4129-b9f9-8637b59ea4b3) channel for discussing project ideas. And of course, you're encouraged to discuss possible topics with me during office hours. Here are some ideas for getting started on projects:
Find a previously published paper related to Robotic Perception (either a recent or classic one), reimplement and test its approach.

Take some publicly available code, apply it to an interesting dataset, explore various extensions and modifications, or compare multiple approaches. Note, however, that merely running existing code on the data provided by the authors is not sufficient -- you need to do more in-depth exploration along the lines suggested above.

Design and implement a solution to a problem that interests you. It is fine to pick a problem related to your dissertation research, but be sure to formulate a clear short-term goal and desired outcome for the class project. Ideally, you should use the class project as an opportunity to try new techniques that you might not consider or have a chance to use otherwise.

Find an interesting competition or dataset. It is not necessary to actually enter the competition -- just use however much of the data or problem definition or evaluation makes sense to you and is feasible in your circumstances.


# Proposal
Your proposal should consist of two to three pages and contain the following:
* **List of group members.**
* **Informative project title.**
* **Project description and goals:** Describe the problem you plan to solve and give a basic outline of what you propose to implement. You can change later as you go along, but try to think this through as much as possible in advance. Identify the desired final outcome and pose maximum and minimum goals.
* **Member roles:** Indicate which project component each group member will be responsible for and how the group will interact.
* **Resources:** Specify what data you plan to use -- include examples of images and any required annotations. What is your implementation platform? Do you plan to use any outside code and how do you plan to build on it? Do you have access to adequate computational resources if your project is computationally intenstive? Be specific and give pointers to all relevant resources.
* **Reservations:** Try to anticipate which part of the implementation or testing may prove the most difficult. Possible stumbling blocks shouldn't necessarily prevent you from attempting a more ambitious project, but you should make sure that you have a realistic "minimum" goal that can be accomplished.
* **Relationship to your background:** Describe how your proposed project relates to your background and current level of knowledge. Which techniques, software packages, etc., are you already familiar with, and which ones will be new to you? If the project is related to your dissertation or RA work, describe the relationship and the amount of overlap. It is fine to pick a problem related to your dissertation research, but be sure to formulate a clear short-term goal and desired outcome for the class project. Ideally, you should use the class project as an opportunity to try new techniques that you might not consider or have a chance to use otherwise. Grading of your project will be relative to your background and the size of your team.

The proposal in PDF format should be uploaded on Gradescope by one designated group member (but make sure that everybody's names are on the document). The proposal will receive feedback but no separate score. 

# Progress report
The progress report should be at least three pages and should be structured as follows:
* **List of group members.**
* **Informative project title.**
* **An updated statement of the project definition and goals.** If there are any changes, discuss them specifically, together with the reasons for these changes.
* **Proposed approach** in the form of a detailed outline, pseudocode, or prose description. Be specific about how you plan to implement each step with references, pointers to external code, etc.
* **Images/data:** description of the kind of inputs, training data (if any), and test cases. Specify the type of data you plan to use (video, lidar, imu, etc.), give URLs to public datasets (if applicable), etc. If your project requires any kind of data collection effort, it is expected to be completed by this stage (or to be close to completion). Examples of the data are required.
* **Initial results:** brief description of which steps of your approach you have already implemented. Evidence of active implementation effort is expected at this stage! As a minimum, you should have compiled and tested any external code.
* **Current member roles and collaboration strategy.** Who is responsible for what? How are the code and data shared/maintained? How does the group interact -- e.g., are there regularly scheduled meetings?
* **Current reservations and questions (if any)**.
* **References** -- a fairly complete list of references is expected.

The progress report should be uploaded on Gradescope by one designated group member (but make sure that everybody's names are on the document). The report will not receive a separate score, but its content and quality will contribute holistically to the overall project grade at the end of the semester.

# Final report
The final report should be submitted in PDF format by one designated group member on Canvas. It should be (the equivalent of) at least six pages (single-spaced, 10 point font) and mimic the style of a research paper. Here is an outline to follow for the report:
* **Cover page:** Executive summary: Give an informative project title and list of authors. Briefly summarize your problem, line of attack, and most interesting/surprising findings. Be sure to include at least one diagram or example result figure. The cover page is not counted in the six-page minimum.
* **Introduction:** Define and motivate the problem, discuss background material or related work, and briefly summarize your approach.
* **Details of the approach:** Include any formulas, pseudocode, diagrams -- anything that is necessary to clearly explain your system and what you have done. If possible, illustrate the intermediate stages of your approach with results images.
* **Results:** Clearly describe your experimental protocols. If you are using training and test data, report the amount of data. Be sure to include example output figures. Quantitative evaluation is always a big plus (if applicable). If you have example or demo videos, put them on YouTube or some other external repository and include the links in your report.
* **Discussion and conclusions:** Summarize the main insights drawn from your analysis and experiments. You can get a good project grade with mostly negative results, as long as you show evidence of extensive exploration, thoughtfully analyze the causes of your negative results, and discuss potential solutions.
* **Connection to course material:** How does the topic of your project relate to the topics, techniques, or themes covered in this semester's syllabus? Be specific -- i.e., list specific lectures, MPs, etc. and relate them to specific parts of your project. If the connection is obvious, this section can be quite short.
* **Statement of individual contribution:** Required if there is more than one group member.
* **References:** including URLs for any external code or data used.

In addition to the report, please submit a zip file of your source code. We are looking for only the most important code that you wrote yourself for the project, not any external libraries. We do not plan to run the code, but want to see it to be able to verify that you actually did the work you claim to have done.

# Grading
Grades will be based on the quality of the project (originality, thoroughness, extent of analysis, etc.) and the clarity of the written report. Ideally, you will try something new or apply ideas from class to your domain or research. More will be expected from groups of two. You can still get a good grade if your ideas do not work out, as long as your report shows evidence of extensive analysis and exploration, and provides thoughtful explanations of the observed outcomes.
