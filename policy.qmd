### What is allowed vs not allowed

- Studying together and comparing understanding *without sharing written solutions*
- Using course notes and posted examples

❌ **Not allowed**
- Copying any part of another student’s written solution
- Copying code, derivations, or calculations (even if you “understand it”)
- Submitting work that is not fully your own
