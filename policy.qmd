## Grading

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
### Grading scheme (overview)

| Component | Weight | What it includes |
|---|---:|---|
| **Assignments** | **40%** | Homework sets and programming/computation tasks |
| **Quizzes** | **20%** | Short quizzes (in-class or announced) |
| **Project** | **40%** | Proposal, checkpoint, final report, and presentation/demo |

## Academic integrity and collaboration

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### What is allowed vs not allowed

✅ **Allowed**
- Discussing concepts and approaches at a high level with classmates
- Studying together and comparing understanding *without sharing written solutions*
- Using course notes and posted examples

❌ **Not allowed**
- Copying any part of another student’s written solution
- Copying code, derivations, or calculations (even if you “understand it”)
- Submitting work that is not fully your own
:::

If you collaborate, your submitted work must be written independently and reflect your own understanding.

---

## Generative AI tools

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
Unless explicitly permitted by the instructor for a specific assignment, the use of generative AI tools for any part of your submitted work is **not allowed** and will be treated as plagiarism.

### Textbooks
- *TBF — Probabilistic Robotics* (Thrun, Burgard, Fox)
Core foundations of probabilistic state estimation in robotics: Bayes filters, Kalman/particle filters, localization, mapping, and SLAM, with a strong emphasis on reasoning under uncertainty.

- *BAR — State Estimation for Robotics* (Barfoot)
A modern, implementation-oriented treatment of estimation: least-squares, Kalman filtering, nonlinear estimation, Lie groups, and continuous-time trajectory estimation.

### *CAK — SLAM Handbook: From Localization and Mapping to Spatial Intelligence* (Carlone, Luca; Kim, Ayoung; Barfoot, Timothy; Cremers, Daniel; Dellaert, Frank)
A broad handbook covering factor-graph SLAM foundations, sensing modalities (camera/LiDAR/radar/IMU), robust optimization, evaluation methodology, and emerging directions in spatial intelligence.

### Software
- MATLAB/Simulink and/or Python may be used for assignments and project work (details will be announced).

### Recommendation
If you need a refresher on rigid-body transformations, Jacobians, and basic dynamics, start reviewing early.  
The Schedule page will list what you need for each week.
