## Submission guidelines

::: {.callout-tip appearance="minimal"}
### What to submit
- Submit a **single PDF** unless the assignment explicitly requests additional files.
- Your submission must be **clear and readable** (high-quality scan or direct PDF export).
- If code is required, include it **as instructed** (either embedded in the PDF or as a separate upload).
:::

### Good practices
- Start **each question on a new page** (recommended).
- For multi-page answers, keep pages in order and label them clearly.
- If using Gradescope, map **pages to questions** accurately.

---

## Late day policy

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
You have **6 late days** total for the semester, with a maximum of **2 late days per assignment**.

- Each late day is a **24-hour extension**.
- No credit is given after **48 hours** past the deadline.
- You are responsible for tracking your remaining late days.

## Collaboration policy and honor code

::: {.callout-warning appearance="minimal"}
### Collaboration rules
✅ **Allowed**
- Discussing concepts and high-level approaches with classmates
- Studying together and comparing understanding *without sharing written solutions*

❌ **Not allowed**
- Copying any part of another student’s solution
- Sharing or copying code, derivations, or calculations
- Submitting work that is not fully your own
:::

If you use any external resources (e.g., a textbook example, an online reference, or a small snippet of code),
you must **cite it clearly** in your submission.

---

## Generative AI tools policy

::: {.callout-important appearance="minimal"}
Unless explicitly permitted by the instructor for a specific homework, the use of generative AI tools for any part of your work is **not allowed** and will be treated as plagiarism.
:::

---

## Regrade policy

Regrade requests must be submitted via the course submission system (e.g., Gradescope) and must include a clear explanation.

- Deadline: within **1 week** of receiving your grade, by **11:59 PM**.
- We reserve the right to regrade the **entire** homework; your score may go **up or down**.

### Legitimate regrade requests
- Points were added incorrectly.
- The grader missed your work because it was on a different page.
- The grader claims your method fails in a specific case, but it works as implemented.

### Illegitimate regrade requests
- Disagreeing with the rubric without a grading error.
- “My solution wasn’t clear, but what I meant is correct.”
